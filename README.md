# File to Folder 

## Why and what?

So I created this application to automate the process of creating folders for specific files and moving them into that folder manually. When you run this script and a directory it will look for files with an extenstion and it will create folder with the name of the basename of the file. 

## Usage
Clone the repo and make sure you have nix installed. Change the folder name in basePath to where you want the script to run and run it

## TODOS
* Add command line passing of target folder
* Cross platform ie Windows Support
* Logging of files moved and there previous names and location to be able to revert back easily.
